hello everyone 
my name is Rocky 
its just an simple text
im studing in SIET college tumkur
it was very good college in tumkur
just try one basic program is related to for loop:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
char name;
printf("enter the name:");
scanf("%c",name);
for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
{
printf("%c\n%d",name,i);
if(name=="rohit")
{
printf("its not ur name");
}
else{
printf("its my name rohit");
when the statement were run then first check with if condition and if its true then print the statement.
}
return 0;
}
This above program tels about how we can get the multiple items at a time using for loop.
this is also happen by usinng wihle loop.
